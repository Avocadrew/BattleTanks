# Battle Tanks
#### Jun-Yu (Andrew) Chen, Ethan Kuan

## Introduction
An game made in Unity 3D designed as a fun mini-game suitable for all kinds of players regardless of gaming experience. The main goal of the game is to gain points by successfully destroy as many enemy bots as possible while surviving attacks. Colliding with crates randomly falling from the sky would nerf the player by slowing movement speed or buff the player by giving various different items.

## Requirements
Created with Unity 2019.4.21f1, while the released .exe is played on Windows (x64, x86) Platforms.

## Controls
WASD to move and Spacebar to shoot. Items are obtained by running into the crates randomly falling from the sky.
